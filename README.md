## Problem Statement
The automobile industry is highly competitive, with multiple brands and models competing for market share. Business leaders need to understand which brands and models drive sales, how performance varies across regions, and how sales evolve over time. While the dataset provides a record of historical sales, it does not directly reveal which brands and models dominate the market, how sales vary by region, or how trends evolve year-over-year.

## Business Objective
The objective of this project is to leverage the car sales dataset to deliver actionable insights that help business leaders make informed decisions. Specifically, the decision-makers need insights into:

1. **Identifying Top Performers** ‚Üí Best-selling brands and models  
2. **Analyzing Regional Trends** ‚Üí Strong vs. underperforming markets  
3. **Tracking Sales Over Time** ‚Üí Yearly and seasonal performance  
4. **Understanding Revenue Drivers** ‚Üí Contribution of premium vs. entry-level models  
5. **Enabling Data-Driven Decisions** ‚Üí Creating an interactive dashboard for stakeholders

## ETL Procedure
**1. Extract**  
- Dataset sourced in Excel/CSV format  

**2. Transform (via SQL):**  
- Removed nulls and duplicates  
- Standardized dates, derived Year, Quarter, and Month  
- Cleaned brand and region values  
- Aggregated sales metrics for analysis  

**3. Load**  
- Final structured dataset loaded into Power BI for reporting and dashboard creation

## SQL Data Modelling
SQL was used to clean, structure, and prepare the dataset. Key techniques included:

1. **Joins** ‚Äì merged tables for consolidated reporting  
2. **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)** ‚Äì modular, step-wise transformations  
3. **Window Functions** ‚Äì `RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()` for ranking top brands/models  
4. **Aggregations** ‚Äì `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT` to compute sales metrics  
5. **Date Dimension** ‚Äì enabled time-series reporting in Power BI  

---

## Power BI Dashboard
The dashboard highlights business-critical insights using:

1. **Slicers & Filters** ‚Üí Year, brand, region  
2. **KPI Cards** ‚Üí Revenue, units sold, average price  
3. **Bar & Column Charts** ‚Üí Brand/model performance  
4. **Line Charts** ‚Üí Yearly and seasonal sales trends  
5. **Maps** ‚Üí Regional sales performance  
6. **Drill-through Pages** ‚Üí Brand/model-level deep dive
